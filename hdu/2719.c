 *    Problem Description
 *    Uniform Resource Identifiers (or URIs) are strings like http://icpc.baylor.edu/icpc/, mailto:foo@bar.org, ftp://127.0.0.1/pub/linux, or even just readme.txt that are used to identify a resource, usually on the Internet or a local computer. Certain characters are reserved within URIs, and if a reserved character is part of an identifier then it must be percent-encoded by replacing it with a percent sign followed by two hexadecimal digits representing the ASCII code of the character. A table of seven reserved characters and their encodings is shown below. Your job is to write a program that can percent-encode a string of characters.
 *    Character  Encoding
 *    " " (space)  %20
 *    "!" (exclamation point)  %21
 *    "$" (dollar sign)  %24
 *    "%" (percent sign)  %25
 *    "(" (left parenthesis)  %28
 *    ")" (right parenthesis)  %29
 *    "*" (asterisk)  %2a
 *    Input
 *    The input consists of one or more strings, each 1–79 characters long and on a line by itself, followed by a line containing only "#" that signals the end of the input. The character "#" is used only as an end-of-input marker and will not appear anywhere else in the input. A string may contain spaces, but not at the beginning or end of the string, and there will never be two or more consecutive spaces.
 *    Output
 *    For each input string, replace every occurrence of a reserved character in the table above by its percent-encoding, exactly as shown, and output the resulting string on a line by itself. Note that the percent-encoding for an asterisk is %2a (with a lowercase "a") rather than %2A (with an uppercase "A").
