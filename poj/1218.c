 *    Description:  
 *    A certain prison contains a long hall of n cells, each right next to each other. Each cell has a prisoner in it, and each cell is locked.
 *    One night, the jailer gets bored and decides to play a game. For round 1 of the game, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall unlocking each cell. For round 2, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall locking every other cell (cells 2, 4, 6, ...). For round 3, he takes a drink of whiskey, and then runs down the hall. He visits every third cell (cells 3, 6, 9, ...). If the cell is locked, he unlocks it; if it is unlocked, he locks it. He repeats this for n rounds, takes a final drink, and passes out.
 *    Some number of prisoners, possibly zero, realizes that their cells are unlocked and the jailer is incapacitated. They immediately escape.
 *    Given the number of cells, determine how many prisoners escape jail.
 *    Input
 *    The first line of input contains a single positive integer. This is the number of lines that follow. Each of the following lines contains a single integer between 5 and 100, inclusive, which is the number of cells n.
 *    Output
 *    For each line, you must print out the number of prisoners that escape when the prison has n cells.
 *    Sample Input
 *    2
 *    5
 *    100
 *    Sample Output
 *    2
 *    10
